# IMPORTANT: gradle-wrapper.jar is missing

Due to network restrictions, the gradle-wrapper.jar file couldn't be downloaded automatically.

## Solution:

When you first open this project in IntelliJ IDEA, it will automatically download the gradle-wrapper.jar for you.

OR

You can manually generate it by opening a terminal in this directory and running:
```
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.5
```

This is a one-time setup and IntelliJ will handle it automatically.
